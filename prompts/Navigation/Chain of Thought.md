 Step 2: Current Position: (1,3), Target: (3,1). Analyze: Still need to move down to row 3, but also left to column 1. Next Move: Left.
 Step 3: Current Position: (1,2), Target: (3,1). Analyze: Continue moving down to row 3, then left to column 1. Next Move: Down. 
Step 4: Current Position: (2,2), Target: (3,1). Analyze: Move down to row 3, followed by left to column 1. Next Move: Left. 
Step 5: Current Position: (2,1), Target: (3,1). Analyze: Only need to move down to align with row 3, as column is already aligned. Next Move: Down.'
