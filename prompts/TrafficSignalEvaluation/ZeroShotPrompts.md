# Testcases for LLM

## Testcase 1

## Debug Info

Combined Lane Pairs Traffic Conditions:
NS-TR: 30 vehicles
NS-L: 6 vehicles
EW-TR: 14 vehicles
EW-L: 5 vehicles

## Prompt

Consider a traffic control scenario at a four-way intersection. The traffic conditions are as follows:

- North Direction: 12 vehicles for through/right, 6 vehicles for left, 0 cycle wait for through/right, 4 cycles wait for left, 7 pedestrians waiting, 2 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.
- South Direction: 18 vehicles for through/right, 0 vehicles for left, 1 cycle wait for through/right, 2 cycles wait for left, 6 pedestrians waiting, 2 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.
- East Direction: 4 vehicles for through/right, 3 vehicles for left, 3 cycle wait for through/right, 1 cycles wait for left, 6 pedestrians waiting, 3 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.
- West Direction: 10 vehicles for through/right, 2 vehicles for left, 1 cycle wait for through/right, 3 cycles wait for left, 1 pedestrians waiting, 1 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.

Based on these conditions, which direction should be prioritized for the next signal change to optimize traffic flow, considering vehicle and pedestrian wait times, counts, and the presence of emergency vehicles?

## Expected Answer

Decision: NS-TR

## Testcase 2

- South Direction: 13 vehicles for through/right, 6 vehicles for left, 4 cycle wait for through/right, 1 cycles wait for left, 4 pedestrians waiting, 4 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.
- East Direction: 5 vehicles for through/right, 4 vehicles for left, 2 cycle wait for through/right, 1 cycles wait for left, 6 pedestrians waiting, 4 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.
- West Direction: 20 vehicles for through/right, 6 vehicles for left, 5 cycle wait for through/right, 3 cycles wait for left, 4 pedestrians waiting, 5 cycles wait since last pedestrian, 0 emergency vehicles for through/right, 0 emergency vehicles for left.

Based on these conditions, which direction should be prioritized for the next signal change to optimize traffic flow, considering vehicle and pedestrian wait times, counts, and the presence of emergency vehicles?

## Decision

Decision: NS-L



## North America Prompt

We are following the North American Traffic control system, Meaning we can open either North south through and right langes, north south left lanes, east west through right lanes, east west left lanes. Now make your decision.
