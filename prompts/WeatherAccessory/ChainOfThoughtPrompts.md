Answer: 

To determine the ideal accessory and clothing choice based on the given data and rules, we need to evaluate the most common weather condition and the average temperature.

1. **Determine the Most Common Weather Condition**:
   - Count the occurrences of each weather condition in the data.
   - We have 'Sunny' on 4 days, 'Snow' on 2 days, and 'Rain' on 1 day.
   - Therefore, the most common weather condition is 'Sunny'.

2. **Choose the Ideal Accessory**:
   - Based on Rule 1, since it's mostly sunny, the ideal accessory is 'Sunscreen'.

3. **Calculate the Average Temperature**:
   - Add up the temperatures: 47.35 - 31.62 + 25.33 - 41.85 + 13.36 + 4.58 + 60.09 = 76.34°F.
   - Divide by the number of days (7) to get the average: 76.34 / 7 ≈ 10.91°F.

4. **Choose the Ideal Clothing**:
   - Based on Rule 2, since the average temperature (10.91°F) is below 32°F, the ideal clothing is 'Warm'.

In conclusion, the ideal accessory choice is 'Sunscreen', and the ideal clothing choice is 'Warm', based on the most common weather condition and the average temperature.
