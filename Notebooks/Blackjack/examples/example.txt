In blackjack, the goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over, while still having a higher total than the dealer. When you have a hand totaling 13 and the dealer shows a 10, you are in a tricky situation. The dealer's 10 is a strong starting card, and the dealer's chances of ending up with a high hand are significant.

1. **Assess Your Hand**: You have a total of 13, which is a weak hand. If the dealer's hidden card (the hole card) is a 7 or higher, they will have a total of 17 or more and will stand, which means your 13 will not be enough to win.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer shows a 10, which is one of the strongest cards for the dealer to start with. Statistically, there is a high probability that the dealer's hole card will give them a total of 17 or more, making it likely that they will beat your 13.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit, any card valued at 9 or higher will cause you to bust (go over 21). There are 4 cards of each rank in the deck, so with 13 in hand, you have a 4/13 or roughly 31% chance of busting with a single hit.

4. **Consider the Odds**: If you stand, you are hoping the dealer's hole card is low and that they will bust when taking additional cards. However, since the dealer has a 10 showing, the odds are against this scenario.

5. **Basic Strategy**: According to basic blackjack strategy, which is a mathematically proven method to minimize the house edge, you should hit when your hand is between 12 and 16 (inclusive) if the dealer shows a 7 or higher. This is because standing on such a low total will most likely result in a loss, as the dealer has a good chance of getting a total of 17-21.

Given all these considerations, the most strategically sound decision would be to take a hit. You are trying to improve your hand, knowing that standing is likely to result in a loss unless the dealer busts.

In this scenario, you have a very strong hand with a total of 20. Here's the thought process:

1. **Assess Your Hand**: With a total of 20, you are in an excellent position. The only hand that can improve yours is an Ace, which would give you a perfect 21. However, the risk of hitting any other card (2-10) would cause you to bust.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer shows a 7, which is a moderately strong card but not as threatening as a 10 or an Ace. The dealer's chances of having a 10 in the hole are high, but even then, they would have a total of 17, which your 20 already beats.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit, you have a very high chance of busting. There are only 4 Aces in the deck that would not make you bust, compared to the 48 other cards that would. That's a mere 4/52 or roughly 7.7% chance of not busting, which is not favorable at all.

4. **Consider the Odds**: Standing on a 20 is almost always the correct play. It's one of the strongest hands you can have, and the odds of the dealer beating your 20 are quite low. The dealer would need a combination of cards that total 21, which is less likely than your chance of winning with a 20.

5. **Basic Strategy**: Basic blackjack strategy would advise you to stand on any total of 17 or higher. Standing on 20 is a fundamental play because it carries a very high probability of winning unless the dealer is exceptionally lucky.

Given these considerations, the most strategically sound decision is to stand. You want to avoid the risk of busting and trust that your strong hand will be enough to beat the dealer's.

In this scenario, you have a total of 7, which is a very low hand and far from 21. The dealer's visible card is a 2, which is one of the weakest cards the dealer can have. Here's the thought process:

1. **Assess Your Hand**: With a total of 7, you are very far from 21. There is no risk of busting on the next card, as the highest card you could draw (a 10 or face card) would only bring your total to 17.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer has a 2 showing, which is not a strong starting card. The dealer has a higher chance of busting with a 2 showing than with any other card except a 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: Since you cannot bust with a single hit, there is no immediate risk in taking another card.

4. **Consider the Odds**: With a hand of 7, you need to improve your hand to have a chance of winning. The dealer's weak card gives you an opportunity to be more aggressive with your play.

5. **Basic Strategy**: Basic blackjack strategy suggests that you should always hit when your hand is less than 12, regardless of what the dealer is showing. This is because you cannot bust, and you have a good chance of improving your hand.

Given these considerations, the most strategically sound decision is to take a hit. You want to increase your hand value to give yourself the best chance of winning against the dealer's weak card.

In this scenario, you have a hand totaling 17, and the dealer's visible card is a 2. Here's the thought process:

1. **Assess Your Hand**: With a total of 17, you have a relatively strong hand. The chances of improving your hand by hitting are slim, as any card above 4 will cause you to bust.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer shows a 2, which is considered a weak card. The dealer has a higher chance of busting with a 2 showing because they must hit until they reach a total of 17 or higher, and starting with a 2 means there's a long way to go with a higher risk of busting.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit on 17, you have a very high chance of busting. There are only 4 cards in the deck (Aces through 4s) that can improve your hand or keep you at 17, and the rest (5s through Kings) will cause you to bust.

4. **Consider the Odds**: Standing on 17 is a standard play in blackjack because it's a strong enough total that you have a good chance of winning unless the dealer ends up with 18 or higher. With the dealer showing a 2, the odds are in your favor that the dealer may bust or end up with a lower total.

5. **Basic Strategy**: According to basic blackjack strategy, you should always stand when you have a total of 17 or higher, regardless of what the dealer is showing. The risk of busting is too great, and you have a decent chance of winning as is.

Given these considerations, the most strategically sound decision would be to stand. You want to avoid the high risk of busting and give the dealer the chance to bust or end up with a lower total.

In this scenario, you have a hand totaling 13, and the dealer's visible card is a 7. Here's the thought process:

1. **Assess Your Hand**: You have a total of 13, which is still a weak hand. You're not in immediate danger of busting with a single hit unless you draw a 9 or higher.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer shows a 7, which is not as strong as a 10 but still puts the dealer in a position where they could end up with a total of 17-21 after revealing their hidden card.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit, you have the same risk of busting as before, with a 31% chance if the next card is a 9 or higher.

4. **Consider the Odds**: With a dealer's card of 7, there's a reasonable chance the dealer will end up with a total of 17 or more, which would beat your 13. However, the dealer also has a chance to bust if their hidden card is not favorable and they're forced to hit.

5. **Basic Strategy**: Basic blackjack strategy suggests that you should hit when your hand is between 12 and 16 (inclusive) if the dealer shows a 7 or higher. This is because standing on a 13 against a dealer's 7 is likely to result in a loss, as the dealer has a good chance of getting a total of 17-21.

Considering the above points, the most strategically sound decision would be to take a hit. You're trying to improve your hand to a stronger total since standing on 13 against a dealer's 7 is not a favorable position.

In this scenario, you have a very strong hand with a total of 20. The dealer's visible card is a 4, which is considered a weak card for the dealer. Here's the thought process:

1. **Assess Your Hand**: With a total of 20, you are in a very strong position. The only hand that can improve yours is an Ace, which would give you a perfect 21. However, any other card would either make no difference (if it's another 10-value card) or would decrease the strength of your hand.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer has a 4 showing, which is weak because the dealer has a higher chance of busting. The dealer must hit until they reach a total of 17 or higher, which means they need to take at least two more cards without busting to beat your 20.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit, any card other than an Ace will cause you to bust or will not improve your hand. The risk of busting is extremely high, and the potential reward (getting an Ace) is not worth the risk considering the strength of your current hand.

4. **Consider the Odds**: The odds are in your favor to win the hand with a total of 20. It's one of the strongest hands you can have in blackjack, and the dealer has a long way to go with a 4 showing.

5. **Basic Strategy**: According to basic blackjack strategy, you should always stand when your hand totals 17 or higher, regardless of what the dealer is showing. This is because the risk of busting is too great and your hand is likely strong enough to win as is.

Given these considerations, the most strategically sound decision is to stand. You want to avoid the risk of busting and trust that your 20 is strong enough to beat whatever the dealer ends up with.

2. **Consider the Dealer's Card**: The dealer has a 4 showing, which is not a good starting card. The dealer has a higher chance of busting with a 4 as the upcard because they must hit until they reach a total of at least 17, and there are many card values that can lead to a bust.

3. **Evaluate the Risk of Busting**: If you hit, you have a very high chance of busting since you can only take an Ace without going over 21. There are only 4 Aces in a standard deck, and the likelihood of drawing one is not in your favor.

4. **Consider the Odds**: Standing on 20 is almost always the correct play. It's one of the strongest hands you can have, and the odds of the dealer beating a 20 are quite low, especially when their upcard is a 4.

5. **Basic Strategy**: Basic blackjack strategy would advise you to stand on any total of 17 or higher, regardless of what the dealer is showing. With a total of 20, you are well above that threshold.

Given these considerations, the most strategically sound decision is to stand. You want to avoid the risk of busting and give the dealer the chance to try to improve their hand, which could lead to them busting.
