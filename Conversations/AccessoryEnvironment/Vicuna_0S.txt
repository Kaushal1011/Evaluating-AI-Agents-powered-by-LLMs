1. Temperature Analysis:
The average temperature over the past 7 days is (47.3 + -31.6 + 25.3 + -41.8 + 13.4 + 4.6 + 60.1) / 7 = 29.2 째F. This indicates that the weather has been predominantly cold over the past week, with only a few days of mild temperatures.
2. Weather Conditions Analysis:
The past 7 days have had varying weather conditions - Sunny (3 days), Snow (2 days), and Rain (1 day). This suggests that there is some unpredictability in the weather patterns.
3. Ideal Accessory Choice:
Based on the temperature analysis, it is likely that tomorrow's weather will continue to be cold. Therefore, carrying a Sunscreen might not be necessary. Given the past 2 days of Snow, there is a possibility of more snowfall tomorrow. Thus, carrying an Umbrella or Snowshoes would be a good idea.
4. Ideal Clothing Choice:
Again, based on the temperature analysis, it is advisable to dress Warmly for tomorrow's weather. The past 2 days of Snow indicate that there might still be snow on the ground, making it necessary to wear appropriate footwear and clothing to prevent slipping and stay warm.
