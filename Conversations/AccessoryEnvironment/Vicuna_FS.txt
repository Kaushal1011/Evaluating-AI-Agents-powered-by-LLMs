Consider the following data about weather conditions for the last 7 days:

- Temperatures (in °F): [22.83072037402046, -5.943323548806106, 18.04667056770205, -3.458765519049905, -19.762368035884755, 36.123639166518316, 0.1366724597284943]
- Weather Conditions: ['Snow', 'Snow', 'Snow', 'Snow', 'Snow', 'Sunny', 'Snow']

Rules:
1. The ideal accessory choice depends on the most common weather condition:
   - If it's mostly sunny, pick 'Sunscreen'.
   - If it's mostly raining, pick 'Umbrella'.
   - If it's mostly snowing, pick 'Snow Boots'.
2. The ideal clothing choice depends on the average temperature:
   - Below 32°F: 'Warm' clothing.
   - Between 32°F and 70°F: 'Medium' clothing.
   - Above 70°F: 'Summer' clothing.

Based on the above data and rules, what should be the ideal accessory and clothing choice? Please explain your reasoning.

 Based on the given data and rules, we can determine the ideal accessory and clothing choices as follows:

* The most common weather condition is 'Snow', which occurs in 4 out of the 7 days (6 days if we exclude the last day with 'Sunny' condition). Therefore, according to rule 1, we should pick 'Snow Boots' as the ideal accessory choice.
* To determine the ideal clothing choice, we need to first compute the average temperature:
	+ Day 1 (22.8°F) + Day 3 (18.0°F) + Day 4 (-3.5°F) + Day 6 (-19.8°F) = 17.0°F
	+ Day 2 (-6.0°F) + Day 5 (-3.5°F) = -3.5°F (average discarded due to negative temperature values)
	+ Day 7 (36.1°F) = 36.1°F
	+ The last day has 'Sunny' condition, which is not included in rule 1 for ideal accessory choice. Therefore, the average temperature only includes the other days:
		- [22.8 + 18.0 - 3.5 + (-19.8) + 36.1]/4 = 8.7°F (rounded to one decimal place)

According to rule 2, since the average temperature is below 32°F, we should choose 'Warm' clothing as the ideal choice.

In summary, the ideal accessory choice is 'Snow Boots', and the ideal clothing choice is 'Warm'.

 Based on the given data and rules, we can determine the ideal accessory and clothing choices as follows:

* The most common weather condition is 'Sunny', which occurs in 5 out of the 7 days. Therefore, according to rule 1, we should pick 'Sunscreen' as the ideal accessory choice.
* To determine the ideal clothing choice, we need to first compute the average temperature:
	+ Day 1 (11.0°F) + Day 2 (25.8°F) + Day 3 (45.7°F) + Day 6 (-1.4°F) = 19.6°F
	+ Day 4 (-4.2°F) + Day 5 (88.1°F) + Day 7 (61.9°F) = 37.0°F
	+ The last day has 'Sunny' condition, which is not included in rule 1 for ideal accessory choice. Therefore, the average temperature only includes the other days:
		- [11.0 + 25.8 + 45.7 - 1.4 + 61.9]/4 = 26.3°F (rounded to one decimal place)

According to rule 2, since the average temperature is between 32°F and 70°F, we should choose 'Medium' clothing as the ideal choice.

In summary, the ideal accessory choice is 'Sunscreen', and the ideal clothing choice is 'Medium'.
