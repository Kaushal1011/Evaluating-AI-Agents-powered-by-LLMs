To determine the ideal accessory and clothing choices based on the given data and rules, we'll first analyze the weather conditions and temperatures over the last 7 days.

Weather Conditions:

There were 7 days in total.
Snow occurred on 6 out of 7 days, making it the most common weather condition.
